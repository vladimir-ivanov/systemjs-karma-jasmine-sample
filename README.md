## Outstanding
1. Better Architecture needed - ideally components based - items manager should also be template driven
2. Methods which access dom should be extracted in a separate dom helper class
3. Same concept as ListItemComponent should be created to present the Add Item to the list widget e.g. AddItemToListComponent - using template etc 
3. SASS needed for css - better material design choice needed (tried this one as I have not used it before)
4. Would be nicer to use TypeScript (produces more maintainable/robust code)
5. Consider using rx.js
6. All unit tests should be written/ integration tests with protractor
7. Gulp/Grunt etc needed to do common tasks or use npm instead - e.g. compression/linting etc
